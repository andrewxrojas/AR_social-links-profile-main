## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project served as a crash course for me as I have not used HTML or CSS for a year and I would like to improve my skill set as a designer. I learned from my peers to contain my body of code with a main element after the html element followed by the display: grid; place-items: center; in order to perfectly center the card one the page.

### Continued development

For future projects I would like to continue learning and developing my css and responsive layout design skill set. Eventually I'd want to add Java Script to my arsenal.
